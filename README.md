# DisableSonicBoom
A PaperMC plugin that disables Sonic Boom attack damage from the warden.

# THIS IS STILL A WIP
I made this plugin a couple of months back and I forgot to publish it to github.

This is a simple but effective plugin and I have planed to add a command to disable/enable it whenever you need.

For now just drag and drop and u should be good to go.
